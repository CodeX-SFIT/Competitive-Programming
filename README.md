# Competitive-Programming

# __To begin Competitive coding there are six steps__:
## 1. Choose programming language
   
   There are 700 programming languages you can choose any of them the topmost programming languages are python, javascript, Java, C++, C. You have to get familiar with basic syntax which would take upto couple of days.<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*YMFKP8e6kR9cbM3IKXBtLw.png" >
## 2. Make your Logic clear
   The logic behind writing programs should be clear. Try to solve the problem yourself using basic inputs, various cases and derive a general logic which satisfies the required condition. Develop your perspective so as to consider the extreme or edge cases as well.
## 3. Time and Space Complexity
   Your logic is clear, the code may also be correct but the output exceeds the given time limit to solve the question, thus it shows a TLE error. This is the most common problem faced by programmers. To overcome this, one has to analyze their code and by using various DS-Algo techniques, obtain a optimal solution which gives the correct output within the given constraints, the more you practice the better you'll be in it.
## 4. Data Structures and Algorithm
   It is like vocabulary more you know about it, more you grow. Learn DSA from various coding sites, watch videos and most importantly practice sufficient problems on the same untill you develop confidence on applying them. A good grip on DSA ensures a strong foundation for programming.

## 5. Practice Regularly
   Make sure you solve atleast one or two coding problems daily. Practicing regularly ensures your concepts are revised, also you get to know new concepts, functions and improves your problem solving skills.
## 6. Participate in Coding Competition
   Participation in contest will make you know where you stand. A healthy competition among your friends, peers or colleagues ensures everyone's growth. Later discussion of problems gets to know you different approaches to solve same problem. Editorials is a must, even if you have successfully solved a problem make sure you see its editorial too because you may find something new or an optimal way.
